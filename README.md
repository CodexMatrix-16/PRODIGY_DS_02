# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 2:

# Titanic Data EDA Project :

# Overview :

- This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and gain insights on the Titanic.

# Dataset :

- The dataset contains both numerical and categorical values.


# Data Cleaning :

- Missing values in the Age column were filled with the mean.
- Missing values in Embarked were filled with the mode.
- The Cabin column was dropped due to more than 50% missing values.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :

- Checked data distribution and summary statistics.
- Explored the relationship between passenger demographics and survival.
- Created visualizations to identify patterns and trends such as survival rate by gender, class, and age group.

# Key Insights :

- Women and children had higher survival rates.
- Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had a better chance of survival.
- Fare price showed a positive correlation with survival probability.
